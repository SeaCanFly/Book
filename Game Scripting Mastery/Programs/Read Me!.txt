PROGRAMS

GAME SCRIPTING MASTERY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This folder contains the entire collection of example programs for Game Scripting
	Mastery. Each example comes in both source and executable form, and source code is
	always accompanied by project (.DSP) and workspace (.DSW) files for Microsoft Visual
	C++ 6.0
	
	This folder contains a subfolder for every chapter that includes executable code and
	demos. Within those folders are further subfolders for each of that chapter's programs.
	Each chapter's folder contains a Read Me file similar to this one that provides a brief
	summary of its covered topics, and more importantly, of the example programs. Please
	make sure to read them for specific compiling instructions and directions.
	
	In addition to this per-chapter information, all Read Me files contain the GENERAL
	PROGRAM NOTES section listed below. This section does not change from one chapter to
	the next, so please remember that the information it contains does not necessarily
	relate to that chapter's programs. It provides a general overview of compiling
	instructions for the book's DirectX-based graphical programs.
	
	I strongly encourage you to browse, study and play with these examples-- it's the best
	way to become familiar with the what the book teaches, and will help complete your
	training as a scripting master. Have fun!
	
GENERAL PROGRAM NOTES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Each project, example or demo in the book comes in both source code form and executable
	form. All of the book's source was compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, so the
	project (.DSP) and workspace (.DSW) files are included as well. Source code is always
	found in the Source/ directory, and executables are always found under Executable/.
	
	It's always a good idea to make a copy of the source on your hard drive. This can be
	done by simply dragging its directory to the destination of your choice. I suggest
	copying the entire Programs/ directory into a safe place on your hard drive, so you'll
	have the entire book's content available at all times.

	Any program that uses graphics or sound is written with my Wrappuh library, which wraps
	the functionality of the Win32 API and DirectX. This is done to save you the trouble of
	sifting through pages of DX/Win32-specific code, but you still have to configure your
	compiler properly in order to compile Wrappuh programs. Specifically, MAKE SURE of the
	following:

		- wrappuh.cpp, wrappuh.h and keymap.h are included in your project.
		- The DirectX export libraries (.LIB) are included with your project
		- Your compiler's path settings include the path to the DirectX SDK.
		- Your version of DirectX is up to date; I recommend 8.1 (the latest at the
		  time of this writing). As a general rule of thumb, install the version
		  included on the CD (unless you already have a more recent one).
		- Include the WinMM.lib library. This can be found in the Lib/ directory of
		  your MSVC++ installation. This file contains a few generic multimedia
		  functions needed by the Wrappuh API-- programs will NOT compile without
		  this file!

	Remember, Wrappuh hides the details of Windows and DirectX, but it doesn't port
	anything. Demos that use graphics and sound will still require a Win32/DX platform to
	run properly.
	
	NOTE: Not all chapters require the Wrappuh library as many example programs are text-
	      based console applications. The above directions ONLY apply to graphical
	      programs, which will be clearly marked in the first section of this document. If
	      an example program is a console application, it will NOT require DirectX or the
	      Wrappuh API, and can be compiled normally. These programs will also most likely
	      compile in non-MSVC++ compilers or even alternate platforms, unless otherwise
	      noted, although I can't make any guarantees.
